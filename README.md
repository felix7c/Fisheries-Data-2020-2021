# Fisheries-Data-2020-2021
Code used in my dissertation in order to analyse a real-life fisheries dataset. After importing, cleaning and processing the data, I created linear regression models for each of the 25 geographical locations in the dataset and use these to compare predator-prey mass relationships between the locations. I also compared the predator-prey mass ratio (PPMR) between different species, and used phylogenetic information for each species to investigate the correlation between predator phylogeny and their prey consumption habits. This was done by plotting a phylogenetic tree and investigating the phylogenetic signal using Blomberg's K.

Some of the code used here is quite repetitive, for example when looking at the unique prey species for each of the predators that I looked at in more detail. However, there were almost 100 predator species and when I was looking at only a handful of them in more detail to write my dissertation, going into each predator species one-by-one was an effective approach.
